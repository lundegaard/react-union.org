title: 'Union'
order: 3
---

`<Union />` component renders your widgets based on provided [_routes_](#route) and the [_widget descriptors_](/union-component-widget-descriptors) in the DOM. The widgets are managed in a single virtual DOM even though their markup might distributed over the DOM.

## Import

```js
import { Union } from 'react-union';
```

or

```js
var Union = require('react-union').Union;
```

## Properties

#### `children` : _ReactNode_

Children of the `Union` component.

#### `onScanEnd` : _function_

Called after the scan of the HTML is successfully done.

#### `onScanError` : _function_

Called when there is an error while scanning the HTML.

#### `onScanStart` : _function_

Called before the scan of the HTML.

#### `parent` : _HTMLElement_

Element in which the scan is running. The default value is `document`.

#### `routes` : _Route[]_

Array of routes that are supported by your application. See section [_Route_](#route).

#### `strictMode` : _boolean_

Enable React.Strict mode. By default `true`.

## Route

An object that is used for pairing a [_widget descriptor_](/union-component-widget-descriptors) with a React widget.

### Properties

#### `path` : _string_

Indicates that a [_widget descriptor_](/union-component-widget-descriptors) with the `data-union-widget` attribute equal to this value should matched by this route.

#### `component`: _React.Component_

The root React component of a widget.

```js
// routeForMyWidget.js

export default {
	path: 'my-widget',
	component: universal(import('./MyWidget')),
};
```

In the example above, we are using the [universal HOC](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component) to achieve asynchronous loading and automatic code-splitting.

## Usage

### 1. Mocking server output

First, we will assume that code below is a part of the output of your server.

```html
<main>
	<p>Static content produced by your favourite CMS.</p>


	<div id="hero-container"></div>


	<p>More static content produced by your favourite CMS.</p>

	<!-- A widget descriptor â€“ configuration of your React widget.  -->
	<script
		data-union-widget="hero"
		data-union-container="hero-container"
		type="application/json"
	>
		{
			"username": "reactlover"
		}
	</script>
</main>
```

As you can see, there is an empty `div` with an `id` of `hero-container`. This is the HTML element where we want to render the widget called `hero`.
To do so, we must create a [_widget descriptor_](/union-component-widget-descriptors).

A _widget descriptor_ is a JSON script element that contains the `data-union-widget` attribute. It tells React Union that the `hero` widget should be rendered into the `hero-container` element and be passed the data `{"username": "reactlover"}`.

### 2. Writing a Hero widget

Great! Now we will write some code for the widget, namely the component `Hero.js`. Every widget must always have a single root component.

```jsx
// Hero.js

// Main component of your Hero widget
const Hero = ({ data }) => `Hello, ${data.username}!`;

export default Hero;
```

The widget simply renders the `username` passed in the widget descriptor content.

### 3. Writing a route for Hero

Next, React Union needs to know where is the code for the widget we called as `hero`.
So we will write simple object with just 2 properties called `route` (in our case `HeroRoute`):

```js
// HeroRoute.js
import Hero from './Hero';

export default {
	path: 'hero',
	component: Hero,
};
```

This one says that if there is a widget descriptor in the DOM with the name `hero`,
we return its root React component passed as the argument of the callback `done` inside `getComponent`.

Please note that to make things simple, we are using a static import of `Hero` component. You can also wrap a component to use dynamic importing (e.g. [`react-universal-component`](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component)).

Also note that if you know [React-router](http://npm.im/react-router), the route format should be familiar to you.

### 4. Write an entry to the application

Finally, we can define our component responsible for rendering widgets based on the provided routes and *widget descriptor*s.

```jsx
// Root.js
import { Union } from 'react-union';
import HeroRoute from './HeroRoute';

const routes = [HeroRoute];

const Root = ({ store }) => <Union routes={routes} />;

export default Root;
```

Just render the Union component with an array of supported routes. In our case, it is just `HeroRoute`.

When `<Union />` is mounted, the `scan` process of HTML starts. The scan process finds the widget descriptors in the DOM and, based on them, `<Union />` renders the appropriate widgets.

The scan is launched if either `Union` is mounted or the reference to the `routes` property changes.

Please note that we have chosen to define the routes alongside the widgets. If you need multiple entry points to your application (or even reuse an existing widget in multiple paths), it might make more sense to define the routes in the entry point (the app) itself - the choice is yours!
